### About Me  
I began my professional journey in technology in 2019, initially focusing on front-end development and web design. Since then, I have accumulated broad experience extending well beyond HTML and CSS. After completing high school in 2023, I enrolled in the Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate program in 2024 — a significant step in my academic and professional evolution.  

Along the way, I adopted **Python** and currently use the **Django** framework for developing robust web applications. I have also delved deeply into front-end tooling (such as **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**), developed a strong foundation in **branding** and **visual identity** to craft strategic and visually engaging websites, and built practical skills in **MySQL**, expanding into **MongoDB** at university.  

Currently, I focus on advancing my expertise in **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** to enhance my capability in building modern, scalable web applications. I also maintain strong proficiency in **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Supabase**, integrating three distinct database technologies in my workflow.
