### About Me  
In 2019 I began my professional journey in technology, initially focusing on front-end development and web design. Since then I have accumulated broad experience beyond HTML and CSS. After completing high school in 2023, I enrolled in the Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate program in 2024 — a significant step in both my academic and professional development.  
Along the way I adopted **Python** and now regularly use the **Django** framework for robust web application development. I have also engaged deeply with front-end tooling (such as Vite and Tailwind CSS), developed a foundation in branding and visual identity to craft strategic and visually engaging websites, and acquired practical skills in **MySQL** while expanding into **MongoDB** at university. Currently, my objective is to advance in **React.js**, **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, strengthening my capacity to build modern web applications.  
Additionally, I have developed strong proficiency in **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Supabase**, leveraging three distinct database technologies in my workflow.
