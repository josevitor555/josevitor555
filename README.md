### About Me
I began my professional journey in technology in 2019, initially focusing on front-end development and web design. This initial focus on **UX/UI and visual identity** is now a core strength, ensuring the robust applications I build are also strategic and highly engaging.

After completing high school in 2023, I enrolled in the Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate program in 2024. I specialize in **Python** (specifically the **Django** framework) for building reliable backends, and I am focused on the modern front-end ecosystem: **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I maintain practical experience with a multi-paradigm database workflow, integrating **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Supabase** across my projects.

### AI & LLM Integration (A Core Differentiator)
I leverage cutting-edge AI technologies to innovate and streamline development, demonstrating proficiency in handling complex API integrations and context management.

| Platform | Type | Use Case/Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LLMs (API Integration)** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude | Chatbots, Intelligent Data Analysis, Semantic Understanding. |
| **AI-Powered IDEs** | GitHub Copilot, Trae, Qoder, Cursor | Code generation, Real-time suggestions, Debugging, Efficiency. |

*One example of application was the implementation of the Gemma Model in addition to the more popular Gemini model. The goal was to test and validate the LLM responses in the application's MVP before the beta release.*
