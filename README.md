### About Me  
I began my professional journey in technology in 2019, initially focusing on front-end development and web design. Since then, I have accumulated broad experience extending well beyond HTML and CSS. After completing high school in 2023, I enrolled in the Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate program in 2024 — a significant step in my academic and professional evolution.  

Along the way, I adopted **Python** and currently use the **Django** framework for developing robust web applications. I have also delved deeply into front-end tooling (such as **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**), developed a strong foundation in **branding** and **visual identity** to craft strategic and visually engaging websites, and built practical skills in **MySQL**, expanding into **MongoDB** at university.  

Currently, I focus on advancing my expertise in **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** to enhance my capability in building modern, scalable web applications. I also maintain strong proficiency in **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Supabase**, integrating three distinct database technologies in my workflow.

### AI & LLM Integrations

Throughout my projects, I have integrated several AI and large language model (LLM) APIs, demonstrating both technical proficiency and the ability to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies in real-world applications. Examples of integrated platforms include:

- **ChatGPT** — OpenAI’s conversational LLM, used for chatbots and context-aware assistants.  
- **Gemini** — Implemented for intelligent data analysis and response generation.  
- **Grok** — Integrated for semantic understanding and natural language tasks.  
- **Claude** — Applied in multi-turn conversation scenarios and workflow automation.  
- **DeepSeekl** — Used for advanced search, recommendation, and contextual reasoning.

These integrations reflect experience in handling API authentication, request/response handling, context management, and embedding AI-powered features into web applications.

### AI-Powered IDEs & Tools

I have experience working with several integrated development environments (IDEs) enhanced with AI capabilities, which have streamlined coding, debugging, and project management. Examples include:

- **VS Code with GitHub Copilot** — Leveraged AI-assisted code suggestions, autocompletion, and refactoring.  
- **Trae** — Used for code analysis and intelligent workflow enhancements.  
- **Qoder** — Applied for AI-driven development insights and code generation.  
- **Cursor** — Integrated for real-time AI-assisted coding and context-aware suggestions.

These tools reflect my proficiency in combining AI capabilities with traditional development workflows to increase efficiency and code quality.
